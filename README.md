# incendioForestal
A forest that must be randomly generated accordingly to a density probability, and then it starts a fire in the middle.
Then this fire propagates accordingly to a probability that each tree has respectively depending on how many neighbours in fire it has. 
The simulation must run second to second showing the fire propagation until there is no tree in fire left.
